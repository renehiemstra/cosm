I am writing a package (registry) manager in go. The file structure is:

cosm/main.go
cosm/main_test.go
cosm/testutils.go
cosm/types/types.go
cosm/commands/project.go
cosm/commands/registry.go
cosm/commands/utils.go

I've attached the files. I want to refactor the tests. I'll give you specific instructions. If you respond with new code / implementation, please only show the changed and new functionality.
